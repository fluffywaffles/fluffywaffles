      h2 A Little Script for Making Gists
      p.
        The fastest way for me to send a snippet of code to a friend is to
        take a screenshot of my monitor.
      p.
        Then, someone said: "For God's sakes, stop sending me screenshots
        of a monitor! I'm not going to read that."
      p.
        So, okay. Time to write a script for quickly uploading a gist from
        my computer. It requires node.js, zsh, and curl. The first thing I
        ever gisted with gist.zsh... is gist.zsh, which you can find here:
        #[a(href="https://gist.github.com/fluffywaffles/416b058bbe50f4e3437ba374e07f3c4c") gist.zsh].
        It is included below, as well:
