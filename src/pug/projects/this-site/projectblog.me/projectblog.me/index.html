        <h2>On Managing Uncertainty</h2>
        <span class="quote" style=" position: relative; left: 40px;"> &ldquo; </span>
            <blockquote style='text-align: left;'>
                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It's almost something I've forgotten - not uncertainty, but the decision to "handle" it, to wrest from it some control. I was so good at my job, in high school - at being a student - that I have an official transcript from Ball State University on which it is declared that I earned 64.000 (with 3 zeroes, for whatever reason) college credit hours with a 4.0 GPA. I was on the Dean's List as a Junior in High School. I took credit overloads during the year and college summer camp courses during the summer. I could have completed a 4 year degree in 2 years, had I gone to any state college in Indiana (or probably elsewhere). This year would have been my senior year. I may not even have needed to stay the whole year, if I'd paid for course overloads the year before. Some places would have paid me a stipend for living expenses so long as I stayed a student. I would be in complete control of my life, my grades, my work-study, everything. And I would have been miserable. </p>

                <p> Incredibly strange, isn't it? </p>

                <p> I think that I over-think things, but it's more interesting. </p>

		<h2>I <em>hate</em> <strong>flat design</strong></h2>
		<hr class="small-divider">	

		<span class="quote"> &ldquo; </span>
		
		<blockquote>I once said that the most difficult things to design are the simplest. For instance, to improve the form of a scalpel or a needle is extremely difficult, if not impossible.
				<cite> &mdash; Raymond Loewy </cite></blockquote>

		<span class="quote rquote"> &rdquo; </span>	

		<p>Raymond Loewy: in a sense, he <em>defined</em> industrial design. He was a genius; a man who, in his own words, sought to make "the daily life of the 20th century more beautiful." He succeeded. Among his famed designs is the coca-cola bottle, the lucky strike cigarette packaging, and a long, iconic line of after-war studebakers in the 1950s.</p>

		<p>He believed in simplicity. He hated plastics and chrome - the design standards of the century, the materials that rapidly and inexorably changed the world. He believed in design that had body, that was simple, that was sleek. <em>The Father of Streamlining</em>, <em>The Father of Industrial Design</em>, <em>The Man Who Shaped America</em>. These are his appelations; his reward for modern obscurity, for excellence and subtlety.</p>

		<span class="quote"> &ldquo; </span>
		
		<blockquote>More than function itself, simplicity is the deciding factor in the aesthetic equation.
				<cite> &mdash; Raymond Loewy </cite></blockquote>

		<span class="quote rquote"> &rdquo; </span>	

		<p>So what in hell is simpler than flat design?</p>

		<p>Nothing. No design at all. I'm talking <a href="http://motherfuckingwebsite.com/">Mother Fucking Website</a> design. WHY THE HELL. DO WE DESIGN. THINGS. SO. COMPLICATED.</p>

		<p>I am text over an image. I am shadows and colors. I am described ENTIRELY in <s>100</s> 103 lines of styles. I do <em>not</em> believe that style should take more space than content. And I already have less than 100 lines of content in this post.</p>

		<p>"But Jordan, is not flat design quite simple?"</p>

		<p>No. Flat design is a rave-siren taped on the breast of a Wordpress-powered, code-bloated beast. Now we not only must bear his ugliness, his bloated, horrid body; now we must pay attention to him. Now he is everywhere, blasting his pastels and long-shadows about like vomit.</p>

		<p>Flat design is the 21st century parallel to Loewy's abhorred plastic. And it is anathema to simplicity. </p>

		<p>I want shelves on an app - wait for it - <em>to look like effing shelves.</em> (I don't know why so many things are designed with shelves, but it seems quite prevalent.)</p>

		<p>I want buttons - don't be surprised, now - to have <em>bevels</em> (gasp!), to have <em>depth</em> (oh gawd no), and to <em>depress</em> when I click them.</p>

		<p>Perhaps worst of all?</p>

		<p>I actually <em>like</em> gradients, pictures, and silly things like <em>letters</em>. I know. I know. Letters? Why the hell do we need letters when I can draw up a vector graphic of an iPhone with long shadows and buttons and animations in SVG that scale to twenty different screen sizes? Hell, Jordan â€” I can make it dance! <em>Dance!</em></p>

		<p>I'd rather you just type out "this is an iPhone app."</p>

		<p>You can still have your fancy vector graphic with animations. Maybe you should ditch the long-shadow, since those are just gross, but you can have the picture. Just make sure you don't forget to tell me what the fuck it is. I don't care what color the background is or what version of iPhone you decided to draw - hell, I don't care if Steve Jobs himself blessed your graphic with his dying breath. <em>Tell me when you show me.</em> I'm tired of videos and iPhones and all that shit.</p> 

		<p>In other words: design should get to the point. Flatness is not simplicity. It's just a different way to brand complexity. </p>

		<h2>Max Capacity Exceeded; please exit the elevator</h2>
		<hr class="small-divider">
		<p>Let me share quickly the list of minor-major-somewhat-scary obligations I have for next quarter -- before the revelations of January 3, 2013. (In no particular order.)
			<ul style="list-style-type: dot; font-size: 75%;">
				<li> <a href="http://fcei.northwestern.edu/curriculum/nuvention/web.html">NUVention: Web</a>
				<li> EPIC&apos;s marketing board (Northwestern's entrepreneurship student group - in particular I'm making/breaking/modificating their website)
				<li> <a href="http://www.aoproductions.net">A&amp;O Productions</a>&apos; marketing board (Northwestern's student-run concert and performance bringing group &mdash; we're updating their website next quarter)
				<li> Being a TA for EECS 111 (because money)
				<li> Working my (admittedly awesome) work&ndash;study job for the <a href="http://web.mmlc.northwestern.edu/">MMLC</a> (again, because <a href="http://youtu.be/TgJ8l5KJeOI?t=2m" title="Please Lord, forgive the 90s. They know not what they do.">$$</a>)
				<li> Taking a full courseload (as an old martial arts instructor once said: "Pain is my friend")
				<li> <s>Continuing to be invariably awesome</s>
			</ul>
		<p> I think I have some reason to be anxious. Perhaps even intimidated. 
		<p> Enter this morning.
		<h3><em> I now have ~$1000 in web development jobs. </em></h3>
		<p> That means my good friend and soon-to-be-coworker came through with two excellent starting clients for our venture to dominate the Indiana web design space. Which is currently pretty <a href="http://www.smallboxweb.com/">much</a> <a href="http://www.summersault.com/">a</a> <a href="http://www.ripfish.com/"> cut</a> <a href="http://www.stormfrontproductions.net/"> and</a> <a href="http://www.visionaryweb.com/"> paste</a> <a href="http://indianapolisseofirm.com/our-services/web-design/">industry</a>. Notice how most of those sites feel naggingly similar. They're all somewhat professional. But none of them (well, maybe with the exception of one) feels particularly... mmmh... exciting?
		<p> Did I mention that with only two clients, we stand to potentially make >=$1000 each?
		<p> I think that's an incredible opportunity. That I'd rather not pass up. So tack another obligation onto that little list up there.
		<h3 title="act now and receive $20 off your next purchase!"> But wait, there's more </h3>
		<p> Before most of that list really solidified, I applied for winter internships with <a href="http://www.1871.com/">1871</a> startups.
		<p> I have been "favorited" for candidacy by <a href="https://www.markitx.com/?gclid=CIrLuJWU47sCFcxAMgodRUgAig">three</a> <a href="http://yellarewards.com/">of</a> <a href="http://packagezen.com/">them</a> today.
		<p> One of them sent me a personalized email.
		<p> I had forgotten entirely about applying to <a href="http://hirebrite.com/events/1871-winter-2013">1871 winter internships</a>, and at the time, I had actually thought I was applying for summer internships anyway!
		<p> Which brings me to my not-so-sudden-or-unexpected realization.
		<p><em>I'm pretty much insane for loading my next quarter so much.</em>
		<p> I need to get off the "commitments for next quarter" elevator, so to speak, before it exits the building. (Do you like how I forced that metaphor back in?)
		<p> Strangely, there isn't a "rescind my application" option on the internships application page... So I guess I'll be sending out "sorry"s and "whoops"s to the wonderfully flattering startups that have been so kindly considering my application.
		<p> Anyway. I just thought I'd share my somewhat unusual day of events.
		<p> And by the way: HOLY CRAP.
		<p> Ahem. That's all.

		<p>Right now, this is raw HTML and CSS.
