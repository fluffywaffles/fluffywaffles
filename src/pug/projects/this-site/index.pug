      h2 History of the Blog
      p.
        It's been a while. I began a blog during my freshman year of
        college, in 201<s>3</s><b>4</b>. It was called projectblog.me
        &mdash; and yes, that was its URL. My registration has long since
        expired, but the projectblog.me archive has been reuploaded for
        posterity (and humility) here:
      ul
        li
          a(href='/projects/this-site/projectblog.me/projectblog.me')
            | fluffywaffles.io/projects/this-site/projectblog.me
          abbr(title='... I just went back and looked at it, and it\'s embarrassing. Enjoy!')
            | *
      p.
        During the life of projectblog.me, it was also used to host
        projects written in HTML/CSS/JavaScript. Some of it is not bad!

        It was remarkably hard to recover all those projects! A few of
        them contained links to assets that I had to find on The Wayback
        Machine and download. (I'm a little surprised they were even
        indexed; but hey! That's what the Wayback Machine is for. Ever
        wonder

        what percentage of votes the purple M&M got in the great M&M
        Global Color Vote of 2002</a>?)
      p.
        After a short time, I started to feel like projectblog.me was a
        couple of things, and none of them what I wanted. It:
      ol
        li Had a weird, sort-of childish name
        li Was basically a diary, and not very general-interest
        li Was really limited (just HTML and some CSS)
        li Was costing me money to host with Dreamhost
        li Was... not really being read by anyone
      p.
        I wanted to build something new; something I would be more proud
        of; something that, maybe, would impress somebody! I was in
        college, so I figured my website was going to get me a job. That
        became the plan: a great, big, impressive, job-getting website.
        For bragging. Seems like a good idea, right? Definitely won't be
        embarrassing later, like that silly projectblog.me thing I did.
    section
      h2 History of fluffywaffles.io
      p.
        The original plan for fluffywaffles.io was to replace
        projectblog.me with something more professional. Something...
        <s>better</s> bragger. The waffle logo dates from this period. I
        never got around to actually creating the website, though. Also,
        the original logo had text overlaid, like so:
      img.sink(
        src='/images/fluffywaffles.png',
        style='background-color: #ffffaa; padding: 20px;',
      )
      p.
        At the time, my personal site was not my only project. I was
        attending a Summer Start-up Incubator at school, working on a
        little web <s>project</s> "company" called
        <a href='/projects/fiddlenaut'> fiddlenaut</a>.
      img.sink(
        src='/images/fiddlenaut-logo.png',
        style='background-color: #2f2f2f; padding: 20px 20px 0 20px;',
      )
      p.
        Fiddlenaut was created to build a website editor, which was called
        <a href='/projects/fiddlenaut/fool'>fool</a>. A lot of my time
        during this period was not take up building fool, however: it was
        taken up by my discovery of
        <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5TW0wJTFLiw'>
        Borderlands 2</a>. Best-laid plans... et cetera.
      p.
        But when I <em>was</em> being productive, I created a lot of
        assets. Nearly everything on the fiddlenaut and fool pages, I
        designed myself: the logos, the little planet icons, the cursive
        text, the layout and the color schemes. I guess I fancied myself a
        designer. (I still haven't quite learned my lesson.)
      p.
        I've reuploaded all of the fiddlenaut and fool webpages for
        posterity, just like projectblog.me. The project never went past
        pulling off some demos with smoke and mirrors, but the copy and
        imagery

      h2 Attempt #2: Animated Waffles
      p.
        A couple years later, I started going over to a friend's apartment
        for weekend hack sessions. I taught myself snap.svg and produced
        the animated waffle that you can see on the homepage today.
