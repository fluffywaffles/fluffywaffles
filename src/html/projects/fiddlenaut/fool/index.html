(Or at least as little as possible.)</p> <p>If you're wondering whether it'll work with your site, <a href=#top>try it out</a>! That's what the bar at the top is for. ;)</p> </div> </section> <section id=faq> <div class=content> <h1>Answers to Your Unasked Questions</h1> <h2>What is Fool?</h2> <p>Fool is a software for editing live websites.</p> <h2>That so?</h2> <p>Yeah.</p> <h2>What is this, specifically?</h2> <p>This is a demo. If you type a web address in that bar up at the top, it'll tell you if Fool works with that website. If it does, you can try it out. Go ahead! Do it!</p> <h2>What does Fool cost?</h2> <p>For now, it doesn't cost anything! Additionally, plans to monetize Fool do not include licensing the software.</p> <h2>Why?</h2> <p>Because we at Fiddlenaut (the company that makes Fool) believe that the experience of editing websites <em>sucks</em>. So we're doing something about it.</p> <p>Oh, did you mean why doesn't it cost anything? Because website editors <em>shouldn't</em> cost anything. The web is supposed to be accessible, and that means things like website editors should be easy to use and cheap.</p> <h2>Did you say this is Open Source? Can I has sauce?</h2> <p>You sure can! Here, <a href=#>check us out on Github</a>. (Pun intended.)</p> <h2>Can I work on this with you? Like, for serious-like?</h2> <p>At this early stage, we don't have the capital to hire. But <a href=#>email us your resume (preferably in website format)</a> if you're still interested. We'd be flattered!</p> <h2>Have you heard of PageCloud?</h2> <p>Yes, but does it matter? Fool: $0. PageCloud: more than that.</p> <h2>Hey, it broke!</h2> <p>That's not a question, but consider <a href=#>submitting a bug report</a>! We'd really appreciate it.</p> </div><img src=images/fiddlenaut-logo-no-text.png class=fiddlenaut> </section>   <script src=scripts/vendor.js></script> <script src=scripts/site.js></script> </body> </html>
